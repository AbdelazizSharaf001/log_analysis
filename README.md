### database

    > this verion is a special programming for `new` database
    provided by [Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd004-ent/parts/72d6fe39-3e47-45b4-ac52-9300b146094f/modules/0f94ae26-c39d-4231-924b-b1eb6e06cf41/lessons/bc938915-0f7e-4550-a48f-82241ab649e3/concepts/a9cf98c8-0325-4c68-b972-58d5957f1a91)

### Python
  - either 2.x or 3.x is tested and running well
  - python modules that the original script runs on:

      Module | version
    ---------|---------
    psycopg2 | 2.8.3 +
    tabulate | 0.8.5 +

    > previous versions should work but it's not tested
    
    if any not installed just install them with
    pip [python 2.x]
    ```bash
    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    pip3 [python 3.x]
    ```bash
    sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    or the script will ask you to install them for you
    this will need `root` previllages on Unix/Linux systems, so just run the script like
    
    '''bash
    sudo ./log_analysis.py
    '''
    > [Note]:
    >
    > The script it self doesn't work with root previllages
    >
    > This just for installing dependances
    
    > You could have a look on the [official pip install](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
    > for just
